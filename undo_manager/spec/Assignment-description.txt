The UndoManager is a small, self-contained example sub-system, packaged
as an Eclipse workspace (you can use another IDE if you like, just grab
the sources from the workspace). It consists of a couple of interfaces
that all play together to fulfill the task of tracking, undoing and
redoing changes to some text document. You can think of it as a
sub-system of a text editor. Note that in order to keep memory usage
limited, the UndoManager should keep only a specified number of
operations to undo (which, obviously have to be the latest changes to
the document).

The task is to understand the interfaces and what role they play in the
UndoManager context and then, based on this understanding, write
implementations of ONLY the UndoManager and UndoManagerFactory interfaces.
What methods do you know to ensure that the code actually does what it
is supposed to do? Apply them!


Please send the implementation of the classes - including any tests / results - back by email.
